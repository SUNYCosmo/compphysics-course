# Numerical Methods for Integration

Numerical integrations are commonplace in scientific modeling and simulations. If several integrations have to be calculated, not only accuracy and precision but the speed at which those can be obtained becomes important. We will attempt to understand all three concepts (accuracy, precision and the speed of calculation) in the context of three methods of numerical integrations given below.

Working with one dimensional integrals, our goal will be to approximate the definite integral:

$$ I(a, b) = \int_a^b f(x)\ dx. $$

### Trapezoid rule

In the trapezoid rule, the integral is approximated by adding the areas of many trapezoids.

### Simpson's rule

## Adaptive Integration
