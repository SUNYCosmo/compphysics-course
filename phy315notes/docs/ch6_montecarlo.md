# Monte Carlo Methods

## Random numbers

Consider the output of the following code:
``` py
    import random
    
    random.seed(1000)
    print (random.random(), random.random())
```

The output will be two numbers printed on the screen. The `random.random()` command gives you a random number between `0` and `1`. The likelihood of getting a particular value between `0` and `1` is the same. In statistical language, such a likelihood/probability is callend a uniform distribution.

## Monte Carlo Integration

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
