# Symbolic Tools and Plotting

## Symbolic Math using Mathematica
`Mathematica` is a popular tool for symbolic math, and is useful for calculating derivatives, integral, and many other tasks.

SUNY Plattsburgh students can installa `Mathematica` on their personal computer. [See instructions here](https://www.plattsburgh.edu/academics/resources/technology/helpdesk/software.html).

### Performing mathematical calculations in Mathematica
Try typing `D[x^2, x]` and pressing `Shift+Enter` to evaluate the cell:
``` mathematica

 In[1]:= D[x^2, x]
Out[1]:= 2 x
```
The command `D[x^2, x]` calculates the derivative of $x^2$ with respect to $x$.

To calculate an integral, use the `Integrate` command as:
``` mathematica
 In[2]:= Integrate[2 x, x]
Out[2]:= x^2
```

Mathematica can perform many popular integrals that show up in various topics of physics and mathematics. For example:  

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-1}^1 e^{-x^2} dx $$
