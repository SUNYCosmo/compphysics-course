### Basic Course Information
The goal of this course is to provide you with some computational and numerical tools that 
are useful in physics and astronomy research. Numerical methods and computational tools 
supplement theoretical and experimental methods which are traditionally the two important 
facets of a scientific discourse. In the modern times, with the rise of computing power, 
computers are increasingly being used to solve (or gain insight about) difficult problems 
that are difficult to address using analytic methods.
