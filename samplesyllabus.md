## Overview
### PHY 3xx - Computational and Numerical Methods I (3 cr.)
An introduction to computational and numerical methods used in physics and astronomy. Includes an introduction to version control, documentation and collaborative code writing. 
Use of open-source matplotlib library to make scientific quality plots. Numerical methods for differentiation, integration, curve fitting and optimization. Basic introduction to random variables and monte carlo methods.  
**Prerequisite(s):** PHY 314, MAT 326, CSC 221

### Basic Course Information
The goal of this course is to provide you with some computational and numerical tools that are useful in physics and astronomy studies and research. Numerical methods and computational tools 
supplement theoretical and experimental methods which are traditionally the two important facets of a scientific discourse. In the modern times, with the rise of computing power, 
computers are increasingly being used to solve (or gain insight about) difficult theoretical problems that are difficult to address using analytic methods.

### Student Learning Outcomes

### Grading
The grading breakdown for the course is as follow:
* Exams: 30%
* Assignments: 20%
* Project Works and Presentation: 50%  
There will be two project work assignments. The first will be an individual project work accompanied by a detailed report. The second will be a group project work (2 or 3 students in a group) accompanied by a presentation. Each of these project works will cover half of the total project work grade. Topics for project work will be suggested and students can discuss their project idea at any time.

Classroom attendance is expected.
